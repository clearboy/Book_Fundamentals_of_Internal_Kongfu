Suggested Final Summary:

Internal Kung Fu is Kungfu practised with an aware mind. A conscious mind. More fundamentally, Internal Kungfu is a skill. As opposed to knowledge you can always deepen your ability to perform it.

Internal Konfu is Konfu with consciousness.

What is internal Kongfu basically?

* Primarily, we define it as kind of skill.  

> Skill is quietly different from knowledge. You become skillful by practicing continually while you get the knowledge instantly. Itâ€™s similar like the process of learning a skill from the very beginning to master with it. We learn it so as to apply for it.

* As for language learning, we use it for better communication to a higher level.

* As for swimming skill, we use it as we could swim freely.

* As for internal Kongfu, we use it to control ourselves physically and mentally to some extent to reach the expectation.

We also name it as Konfu with consciousness.

Why we stress on that we should use our consciousness to realize the control of ourselve physically and mentally?

We also have External Kongfu versus Internal Kongfu. What is the different between them? We would not judge on which one is more premium. The difference lies in whether you practice Kongfu with all your consciousness.

Konfu with consciousness includes two parts basically. One is to use our consciousness, the other is how to do with our consciousness.

Whether you do with all your consciousness tells us how you love it.

To a further extent, whether you do it with consciousness tells us how deeply you understand it.

We have the experience of watching performance of popular star on live.

The experienced super star would improve the performance in all ways emotionally, sentimentally, consciously and infectiously.

For an experienced singer who have reached a high vocal level technically, a good mentor would guide the disciple to higher level by sharing the experience of how he feel on stage, what he is imaging while singing, the comprehension of the lyrics, the control of the emotion, how they deeply moved by themselves and how they express all above to influence the audience.

Techniques of using consciousness is much more difficult than the visible vocal techniques.

It is easier to practice physically with every fist or punch. But it is really hard to pursue the invisible internal force and Taoism.

IMy understanding: Internal kung fu is a skill. As opposed to knowledge, you can always deepen your ability to perform this skill. Also, kung fu has 2 parts: the internal and external. The difference is the heart of the effort. The heart of the effort is your spirit directed at a purpose or target.

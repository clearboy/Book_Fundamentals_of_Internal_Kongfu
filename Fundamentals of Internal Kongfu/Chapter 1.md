Suggested Final Summary:

Internal Kung Fu is Kungfu practiced with an aware mind. A conscious mind. More fundamentally, Internal Kungfu is a skill. As opposed to knowledge you can always deepen your ability to perform it. As with most skills we learn, we learn this skill so that we may apply it. We apply or use internal Kungfu to help us control ourselves physically and mentally so that we may optimally direct our energies to any purpose we choose. Also, KongFu has two parts, the Internal Kongfu and the External Kongfu. The difference is the presence or absence of the heart of the effort, or consciousness of actions.

Open Question: _I am still unclear on the section by Jade where she starts delineating consciousness and its use VS consciousness and its how tos... I dont know how that fits into the discussionbof the heart of the effort or your spirit. _

Internal Konfu is Konfu practiced with an aware mind.

What is internal Kongfu basically?

* Primarily, we define it as kind of skill.  

> Skill is quietly different from knowledge. You become skillful by practicing continually while you get the knowledge instantly. Itâ€™s similar like the process of learning a skill from the very beginning to master with it. We learn it so as to apply for it.

* Language is kind of skill, the application lies in the degree and ability to communicate by mastering one specific language.

* Swimming is kind of skill, the application lies in the ability to swim under water freely.

* Internal Kongfu is kind of skill, the application lies in the degree and ability of controlling ourselves physically and mentally with the heart of the efforts to reach the expectation.We named it Kongfu with the heart of the efforts.

Why we stress on that we should use our consciousness to realize the control of ourselve physically and mentally?

We also have External Kongfu differs Internal Kongfu. What is the different between them? We would not judge on which one is more premium.

The difference between them is whether you practice Kongfu with all your heart efforts from beginning,as purpose,method and guideline.

Konfu with heart efforts includes two steps basically.Firstly we use heart efforts to do all sorts of things.Secondly we need to know how to do things with heart efforts.

Whether you do things with heart efforts or not resents us how you love it.

Whether you know how do things with heart efforts presents us the depth and the levels you practice.

We have the experience of watching performance of popular star on live.

The experienced super star would improve the performance in all ways emotionally, sentimentally, consciously and infectiously.

For an experienced singer who have reached a high vocal level technically, a good mentor would guide the disciple to higher level by sharing the experience of how he feel on stage, what he is imaging while singing, the comprehension of the lyrics, the control of the emotion, how they deeply moved by themselves and how they express all above to influence the audience.

Gaining techniques of heart efforts is much more difficult than the visible vocal techniques.

It is easier to practice physically with every fist or punch. But it is really hard to pursue the invisible internal force and Taoism.

* * * -

My understanding: Internal kung fu is a skill. As opposed to knowledge, you can always deepen your ability to perform this skill. Also, kung fu has 2 parts: the internal and external. The difference is the heart of the effort. The heart of the effort is your spirit directed at a purpose or target.

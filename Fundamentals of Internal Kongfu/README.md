I occasionally started to learn Kongfu. Since then, it has become one unseparated part from my life.

The journey to learn Kongfu is like an adventure to the core of the earth.

I don't dare to keep the beauty of Kongfu for secret, so I would like write these articles as entry guidance to the new learners of internal Kongfu. I will show the directions of right way. I will make a series of article like a album to show the beauty of learning Kongfu. And I will also make some warning signs for the wrong way.   

This is the original motivation for me to write this series of articles.

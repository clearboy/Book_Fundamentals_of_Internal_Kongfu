I occasionally started to learn Kongfu. Since then, it has become one unseparated part from my life. Isabella's rewritten auggeations are in _italics_ -- &gt; _Ever_ _since I began learning Kungfu, even though I started out my practise in small occasions here and there, it could no longer be separated from my life._

The journey to learn Kongfu is like an adventure to the core of the earth.

I don't dare to keep the beauty of Kongfu as a secret, _and_ so I would like to write these articles as _an_ entry guide to the new learners of internal Kongfu.

I will show the directions of right way. _I will show the right direction to go._

I will make a series of article like a album,_ and_ show the beauty of learning Kongfu.

I will also make some warning signs for the wrong way.

This is the original motivation for me to write you these series of articles.

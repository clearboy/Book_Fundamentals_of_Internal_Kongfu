Why we learn internal Kongfu?

There are many misleading arguments, such as:

* Some learns internal Kongfu for body healthy. But there are many other approach to keep body healthy, such as moxibustion.
* Some learns internal Kongfu as body exercise. But you can also run.
* Some learns internal Kongfu to protect himself from attach, but you can learn boxing.
* Some learns for spirit cultivation. But meditation is the best way to cultivate your spirit. 

If we keep on questioning, seldome can give a through thought on why they learn internal Kongfu.

This is very dangerous to learn internal Kongfu if you are not fully understand why you learn internal Kongfu.

Here are the reasons that I am convinced the internal Kongfu is the last one to learn.

### First, view from the point of physical exercise, the internal Kongfu is one of the very few martial arts that both preserves healthy and real combat.

Since ancient times, there are numerous training system that improves your health or attach skills. But seldom of them can balance these two kinds of aims. Most attach skills hurts your health.

If the training only emphasis combat techniques, ....

### Second, view from the point of spirit cultivation, to learn internal Kongfu is one of the shortcuts in pursuing Taoism.

Taoism is the fundamental principle of the society and the worlds.

Why we can learn Taoism through internal Kongfu?

1. The principle of internal Kongfu comes from the nature, and the purpose of learning internal Kongfu is to learn from the nature. And Taoism is actually the learnt principles of mother nature.

2. The learning method of internal Kongfu is as the same as monasticism.

In the pursuit of learning, knowledge is increased daily. While in the pursuit of Dao, actions are reduced daily.

_**Regarding whether it’s authentic or not.**_

_Most people who practice martial arts would really concern whether it’s authentic or not._

_However, the criteria of authentic is quietly personal thing._

_We’d rather spend time to practice internal Kongfu better than argue if it’s authentic or not._

_**Regarding the controversial of internal or external Kongfu**_

_There is no absolute definition of  internal kongfu or external Kongfu._

_We admire people who keep challenging himself and achieve higher level of Konfu always, regardless of any genre of kongfu._

_**Regarding the difference between the internal and external Kongfu.**_

_The differences lie in under which guideline the Kongfu is practiced._

_We see that external Kongfu stress mainly on the physical exercise while the internal Kongfu stress on the mental exercise and the heart of efforts. _

_Both of two genres of Kongfu are interactive which is hard to classify._

_**Regarding the Kongfu and moves**_

_The purpose of practicing martial arts is that we could fight back properly when attacked or in danger._

_The way of the attack is varied, how we fight back as facing changing situation._

_We would train people to adapt to all kinds of possible attack._

_The key point of practicing internal Kongfu is not limit to some specific move but change your strategy as according to your opponent._

_To inspire your instinct of responding dangerous situation instantly in flexible move or strategy._

If you are luck to find a good Shifu, you cann't become a pretice unless you pass the assement from Shifu.

### 1. Learn the Taoism before learn from Shifu
The purpose to be a prentice is to learn the Taoism better. A good Shifu is a role model, who practises Taosim in every day lives.

But we need be cautious not to be foolished by bad Shifu. Always have independent and objective spirit to have a right and clear view and judgement.

We need learn the basis princciples of Doasim first, then we can recogenize the good Shifu from bad Shifu.

### 2. Once you foun right Shifu, believe in him without any doubt
Once you spent hard efforts and finnally found the good Shifu, you need belive him without any doubt. A good Shifu knows about you very well, he knows your charatersisc, your strength and weaks. More important, he knows the most suitable teaching approach for you.

In the beginning, Shifu inspires your interests. He tailures the Kongfu to a special training process that is easy for you to learn. Don't doubt why you learn different things from the other students. Shifu may refuse to answer your questions because it is too early for you to understand them totally.


### 3. Regards Shifu like a father during your whole life
Your father gave you the birth and your fresh. Although Shifu has no blood relationship with you, he teaches you physically and spiritally. Your spirits grow after you learn Taoism to know the basis principle of the nature. 

Shifu gives you second life, like a computer is upgraded by operation system software. 

### 4. Learning good skills is always the best return to Shifu


### 5. We are brothers with other prentices

A qualified prentice should treat the other prentices as brother or sister. 

Respect the other prentices. They are like the mirrors that shows your strengths and weakness. Learn and improves with them together.

### 6. Inherit the linage of our family and pass on.
A qualified prentice should not only learn good Kongfu for him, but also takes the responsibility to inherit the linage of our family and pass on.
